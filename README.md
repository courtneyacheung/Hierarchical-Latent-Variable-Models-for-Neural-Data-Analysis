# Hierarchical-Latent-Variable-Models-for-Neural-Data-Analysis

This project aims to learn latent neural trajectories (lower dimensional systems underlying observed neural behavior) by applying variational Gaussian process factor analysis (vGPFA) to spike train data recorded from studies on decision-making in mice. In quarter 1, we start by simulating data and testing vGPFA under two trial conditions.


## Running the project

* To install the dependencies, run the following command from the root directory of the project: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

The file "cleaned_q1_code.ipynb" starts by running "!pip install git+https://github.com/yuanz271/vlgpax.git"
